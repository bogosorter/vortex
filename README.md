- Handle "lost" downloaded episodes bug
- Implement a queue
- Add download cancel option
- Implement auto-downloads
- Saved episodes are not ordered
- Fix RSS parsing (for example, TAL tags are not correctly parsed)
- Add a "queue is empty" message
- Correctly handle replay of episodes that were already completed
